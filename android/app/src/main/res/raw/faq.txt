? I still see jitter in videos. Why?
? Despite the fact that AFRd correctly switches refresh rate, I still
? see frame jitter on playback.

! AFRd is not a magic pill, it will just switch display mode to one
! that is most suitable for current movie.

! Everything else depends on a lot of other factors - the quality of
! video stream, the quality of the hardware decoder, the program
! for playing video, the setup of your TV.

? Green-ish/purple-ish image during playback
? Sometimes during playback image becomes "greenish" (sometimes:
? "purplish"). What do I do?

! The usual reason for these faults are loose connections on
! HDMI bus between the TV box and the TV.

! Try replacing the HDMI cable with something of a better quality:
! less flexible are better (although less handy), ferrite rings
! are a bonus (bulges near the ends of the cable).

! Also try inserting the cable into a different HDMI jack, if it
! is possible.

? Black screen on refresh rate switch
? Sometimes after refresh rate switching screen becomes black and
? won't restore (sometimes: will restore after video stops, or:
? restores after I reboot the box).

! This is your TV fault. Refresh rate switching is a stress situation
! for a TV - it has to determine all the parameters of the incoming
! video signal. Sometimes it fails to do it correctly, and it just
! 'hangs', although this depends from model to model.

! Some people assert that this does not happen if you switch HDMI bus
! to RGB format (normally video signal is encoded in the YUV format).

? How I can switch the HDMI bus to RGB format?
? I heard this can help with "greenish image" / "black screens" /
? bad karma etc.

! Open "Settings" -> "Advanced settings" -> "Color space selection rules".
! Replace the value "...=444" with "...=rgb". Don't touch the "420"
! mode - it is not possible to transmit an RGB stream at 4k resolution
! and >30hz refresh rates via HDMI 1.x.

? My TV doesn't "like" certain refresh rates
? I use the "Prefer exact refresh rates" option but, still, I want to use
? 60Hz refresh instead of 30Hz. How can I do it?

! Open "Advanced settings" -> "Blacklisted refresh rates" and add the
! refresh rate of 30 (and, possibly, 29.97) Hz to the list.
